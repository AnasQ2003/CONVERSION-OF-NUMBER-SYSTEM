# CONVERSION-OF-NUMBER-SYSTEM
The project aims to develop a Linux-based operating system lab project using Python language and GUI for number conversions. The project will allow users to convert decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers using Python language and GUI. The project will be developed using the Ubuntu 20 LTS operating system, which offers a stable and secure environment for software development. Python (version 3) will be employed to implement the functionality of the project, and Tkinter module in Python will be used to create the graphical user interface. The project will be tested thoroughly using PyTest framework and documented using Sphinx documentation generator. The project will also be maintained regularly to address any bugs or issues that arise over time and ensure its continued reliability and usability for users.
